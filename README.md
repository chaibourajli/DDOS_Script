In computing, a denial-of-service attack is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to a network.
DDOS is highly ilegal, the use of the script should be ethical. You can install an apache server on a VM and use it on your own machine.
